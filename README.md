# Fractals Generator

This project is made for the IN55 UTBM's course. It's a simple program that allow the user to generate 3D fractals as they want with different shape (cube, pyramid...) and export the generated object as 3D printable object file.

## Project installation 

This project need some basic requirements on your machine, like Python3. If you don't have it, install it first.
After this go in the code folder and create a new virtual environnement using virtualenv (if you haven't installed it yet, I let you check how to do it):
```virtualenv venv```
You also need to activate your newly created venv (you can automate entering and exiting of your virtualenv when entering and exiting project folder by using direnv tool):
```source venv/bin/activate```
Now, we need to install the project requirements:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Then, to launch project, you just have to use ```python main.py```
